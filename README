This java library is built using an ANT build script (build.xml).
To build this project, you need:
    - JDK 1.6
    - Ant

Eclipse project files are included, but any editor may be used.
You will need to run an ant task to generate jaxb classes after first opening in eclipse.


Files:
    - All non-generated source code is in the "src/" directory.
    - All generated source code is created in a "gensrc/" directory, by the ANT target "gensrc".
    - Schemas and sample files are in the "etc/" directory.

Interesting Classes:
    - gov.usgs.earthquake.event.Converter has methods for converting most formats.
    - gov.usgs.earthquake.quakeml.FileToQuakemlConverter is an interface for parsers to create Quakeml from other formats.


> NOTE: on Java 1.8+, you must run ant with ANT_OPTS for the XJC tasks to run
>
> 	ANT_OPTS="-Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=all" ant all
